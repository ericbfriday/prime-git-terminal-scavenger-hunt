# Git and Terminal Scavenger Hunt

Follow these steps. This is a solo activity, but don't hesitate to get help from others. We just want everyone to try it themselves. 

## Terminal
Challenge yourself to do this all within terminal. Each step will require at least one terminal command. Open the terminal application to start.

1. Go to the directory (folder) where you store your code. If you don't have one, make one.
2. Make a new directory for the project we will create. 
3. Make a new `index.html` and `script.js` file inside this new project directory. Add some initial code to the repository testing that the script and html are linked correctly.

## Git and GitHub
Now that we created our code files, let's track them in git and GitHub. All these commands should be run inside the project directory.

1. Initialize the project directory as a git repository locally.
2. Check the status of the repository. 
3. Stage the files to be committed. 
4. Commit the files.
5. Create a repository on the remote (GitHub).
6. Link the remote repository with the local one created above.
7. Get your changes up on Github.

## Hard Mode
If you finished the above steps, here are somethings to try. 

### A few more terminal things
1. List all the files in your current directory.
2. Same as above, but this time including hidden files. Were there any hidden files? What do you think they are for?
3. Navigate up a single directory. 
4. Create a file called `bob.html`.
5. Create a directory `test-project`.
6. Move `bob.html` into `test-project`. 
7. Change the file's name to something more logical.
8. Make a copy of the file.
9. Delete the original file.
10. (Carefully) Delete the whole directory. 
11. Go back to home using only the `cd` command.

### A few more git things
Look into a few more git commands listed below and see if you can figure out what they do. Google them or look at the documentation here: [https://git-scm.com/docs](https://git-scm.com/docs)

0. This first one is not a command, look into `.gitignore` files. Create one, ignore the `.DS_Store` file, and check in the `.gitignore`. 
1. `git diff`
2. `git checkout`
3. `git log`
4. `git blame`
5. `git pull` vs `git clone` (which you have used)
6. `git stash`

If you get through all the above, start on tonight's homework. Here is a preview: _Find an [Edabit](https://edabit.com/explore) problem you haven't solved. Solve it in your script file, commit these changes with git and push them to GitHub._
